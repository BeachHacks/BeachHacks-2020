                                The great thing about technology is that we're all connected by it and no matter what you're studying, there's a technology you use everyday as a part of your work.
                                For example, if you're a underwater basket weaving major, you could write a social media app for underwater basket weavers and exchange weaving patterns, color schemes, etc.
